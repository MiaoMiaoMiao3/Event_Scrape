# Scraping the Web and Sending Emails With Google Cloud

## Overview
Like most people today, I find it hard to discover things outside of the house that I can actually do with all the social distancing restrictions in place <br/>
(a girl can only watch so much Netflix). I decided to write a program to combat the cabin fever by scraping the web for events around my home town and sending <br/>
me a email weekly with events found. It seemed like a worthy cause. ðŸ˜Š <br/>

## Requirements
To execute this program you will need:
- A Google Cloud account
- An email delivery service account (I used Mailjet in this case)
